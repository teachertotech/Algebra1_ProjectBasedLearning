# Project-Based Learning Algebra 1 Projects

This repository contains five comprehensive project-based learning activities designed for 9th-grade Algebra 1 students. These projects integrate real-world applications with algebraic concepts to enhance student engagement and understanding.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Budget Planning Project 
Students create a detailed budget for a hypothetical scenario, applying algebraic equations to real-world financial planning.

### 2. Theme Park Design Challenge
Students design a theme park, using algebra to plan various aspects such as ride dimensions, park layout, and financial projections.

### 3. Sports Statistics Project
Students analyze the performance of a sports team using algebraic methods and statistical analysis.


### 4. Environmental Impact Study Project
Students assess the environmental impact of a specific activity or project through data collection and algebraic analysis.


### 5. Algebraic Art Project
Students create artworks using algebraic equations and geometric principles.
(No one chose this one, so I did not create the subsequent documents for this one.  I will in the future because I think I will use it next year as an exemplar.)


### 6. Military Aircraft Algebra 
I created a separate project for a student who had an immense passion for Military Aircraft.
